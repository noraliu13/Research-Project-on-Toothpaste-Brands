## Background Information
Tooth enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, composed mainly of minerals like calcium and phosphate ions. This highly mineralized structure protects the tooth from external degradation, particularly from acids that can break down enamel over time. Acids often come from the food we consume, where various substances, especially sugars, interact with bacteria in the mouth to create acidic environments. The interaction of these acids with enamel leads to the process of demineralization, where essential minerals are leached from the enamel.

The primary inorganic components of enamel include 95% to 98% calcium and phosphate ions, which form a crystalline structure known as hydroxyapatite Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub><sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>). This mineral is what gives enamel its exceptional hardness, enabling it to withstand powerful forces and the daily wear and tear from chewing.

However, tooth enamel is susceptible to demineralization due to the action of acids produced by bacteria, especially Streptococcus mutans, in the presence of sugar. This demineralization process occurs continuously alongside remineralization, where saliva redeposits calcium and phosphate ions back into the enamel. The pH level plays a significant role in this process: when the pH drops below 5.5, acidic conditions cause calcium and phosphate ions to leach out of the enamel, leading to weakened and eroded enamel. Over time, if this process continues unchecked, the enamel breaks down, forming cavities and allowing bacteria to penetrate the tooth surface, which leads to decay.

Hydroxyapatite is an equilibrium system that is sensitive to changes in acidity. The presence of acids from food can shift this equilibrium, dissolving hydroxyapatite and promoting further demineralization. This process is represented by the following chemical reactions:

PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> → HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>
OH<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> → 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>
Fluoride, when present in toothpastes, can help prevent demineralization by forming fluorapatite Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(F)<sub>2</sub>, which is more resistant to acid attacks. Calcium phosphate toothpastes, on the other hand, help by restoring calcium and phosphate ions to the enamel, promoting remineralization.

## Experimental Model Using Eggs

Eggs are used as a model for tooth structure since eggshells are primarily composed of calcium carbonate, which behaves similarly to hydroxyapatite. The carbonate ions in the eggshell will react with protons in acidic conditions, mimicking enamel demineralization. The eggs will be soaked in toothpaste solutions to absorb various ions and later exposed to acid. It is hypothesized that:

- **Stannous Fluoride** will be the most effective in remineralizing the eggshell.
- **Calcium Phosphate** will be the second most effective.
- **Activated Charcoa**l will be ineffective in remineralizing the eggshell.

It is predicted that the eggs soaked in stannous fluoride and calcium phosphate toothpaste will show smaller changes in conductivity and mass compared to those soaked in activated charcoal toothpaste.

Teeth often undergo demineralization, whereas toothpaste helps replenish the enamel as discussed earlier. Throughout this lab, we used eggs to mimic the enamel of the teeth because they have a similar chemical and mineral composition. We soaked the eggs in toothpaste solutions for a few days before leaving them in vinegar overnight. This process mimics brushing our teeth and drinking acidic drinks such as coffee. Our results revealed that Stannous Fluoride showed the smallest difference in lost mass, followed by Calcium Phosphate, Charcoal, and lastly, the control egg that had not been soaked in toothpaste before.

*<sub>Table 2: Conductivity of each vinegar solution before and after soaking the eggs in toothpaste. Stannous Fluoride showed the smallest difference, with the control egg showing the most significant change.</sub>*

The conductivity of the solutions was recorded throughout the procedure to track the leaching of ions into the vinegar solution. The difference in conductivity was noted before and after the eggs had been soaked, reflecting the change in ion concentration. Stannous Fluoride lost the least amount of ions, followed by Calcium Phosphate, then Charcoal. The control egg, with no toothpaste, lost the most ions, indicating that the toothpaste treatments helped to minimize ion leaching from the eggshells.

### Explanation of Results - Why the Toothpaste worked

The egg covered in stannous fluoride showed the smallest difference in mass and conductivity, indicating that less calcium carbonate was dissolved into the vinegar. **But WHY?**
- Both calcium carbonate and calcium fluoride are held together by ionic bonds.
- The displacement of the bases improves acid resistance.
- The double displacement reaction replaces calcium carbonate in the shell with calcium fluoride, a more insoluble compound.

### Chemical Reaction: SnF₂ + CaCO₃ → SnCO₃ + CaF₂
The Kb value of carbonate is greater than that of fluoride.
- **Fluoride (F⁻):** 3.7 × 10<sup>-11</sup>	
- **Carbonate (CO₃²⁻):** 2.1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>	

Fluoride is a weaker base, so less fluoride dissociates in acidic conditions, making the calcium fluoride more resistant to dissolution than calcium carbonate.

### Calcium Phosphate:

- Calcium phosphate is insoluble in water but has an amorphous structure.
- The lack of an ordered molecular arrangement makes it less stable and more soluble.
- Under various conditions, it can dissociate and bond with more ions, forming a proper crystalline structure.
- This structure offers some acid resistance but is less effective than stannous fluoride.

## Part 2: Neutralization

To test the neutralizing abilities of each toothpaste, we titrated acid into each solution and observed their pH graphs. The equivalence point was determined when the moles of base (B) equaled the moles of acid (A). From the equivalence point, we identified the midpoint, at which pOH equals pKb.
