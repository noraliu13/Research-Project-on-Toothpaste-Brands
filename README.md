## Background Information
Tooth enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, composed mainly of minerals like calcium and phosphate ions. This highly mineralized structure protects the tooth from external degradation, particularly from acids that can break down enamel over time. Acids often come from the food we consume, where various substances, especially sugars, interact with bacteria in the mouth to create acidic environments. The interaction of these acids with enamel leads to the process of demineralization, where essential minerals are leached from the enamel.

The primary inorganic components of enamel include 95% to 98% calcium and phosphate ions, which form a crystalline structure known as hydroxyapatite Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub><sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>). This mineral is what gives enamel its exceptional hardness, enabling it to withstand powerful forces and the daily wear and tear from chewing.

However, tooth enamel is susceptible to demineralization due to the action of acids produced by bacteria, especially Streptococcus mutans, in the presence of sugar. This demineralization process occurs continuously alongside remineralization, where saliva redeposits calcium and phosphate ions back into the enamel. The pH level plays a significant role in this process: when the pH drops below 5.5, acidic conditions cause calcium and phosphate ions to leach out of the enamel, leading to weakened and eroded enamel. Over time, if this process continues unchecked, the enamel breaks down, forming cavities and allowing bacteria to penetrate the tooth surface, which leads to decay.

Hydroxyapatite is an equilibrium system that is sensitive to changes in acidity. The presence of acids from food can shift this equilibrium, dissolving hydroxyapatite and promoting further demineralization. This process is represented by the following chemical reactions:

PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> → HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>
OH<sup>-</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> → 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>
Fluoride, when present in toothpastes, can help prevent demineralization by forming fluorapatite Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(F)<sub>2</sub>, which is more resistant to acid attacks. Calcium phosphate toothpastes, on the other hand, help by restoring calcium and phosphate ions to the enamel, promoting remineralization.

## Experimental Model Using Eggs

Eggs are used as a model for tooth structure since eggshells are primarily composed of calcium carbonate, which behaves similarly to hydroxyapatite. The carbonate ions in the eggshell will react with protons in acidic conditions, mimicking enamel demineralization. The eggs will be soaked in toothpaste solutions to absorb various ions and later exposed to acid. It is hypothesized that:

- **Stannous Fluoride** will be the most effective in remineralizing the eggshell.
- **Calcium Phosphate** will be the second most effective.
- **Activated Charcoa**l will be ineffective in remineralizing the eggshell.

It is predicted that the eggs soaked in stannous fluoride and calcium phosphate toothpaste will show smaller changes in conductivity and mass compared to those soaked in activated charcoal toothpaste.

Teeth often undergo demineralization, whereas toothpaste helps replenish the enamel as discussed earlier. Throughout this lab, we used eggs to mimic the enamel of the teeth because they have a similar chemical and mineral composition. We soaked the eggs in toothpaste solutions for a few days before leaving them in vinegar overnight. This process mimics brushing our teeth and drinking acidic drinks such as coffee. Our results revealed that Stannous Fluoride showed the smallest difference in lost mass, followed by Calcium Phosphate, Charcoal, and lastly, the control egg that had not been soaked in toothpaste before.

*<sub>Table 2: Conductivity of each vinegar solution before and after soaking the eggs in toothpaste. Stannous Fluoride showed the smallest difference, with the control egg showing the most significant change.</sub>*

The conductivity of the solutions was recorded throughout the procedure to track the leaching of ions into the vinegar solution. The difference in conductivity was noted before and after the eggs had been soaked, reflecting the change in ion concentration. Stannous Fluoride lost the least amount of ions, followed by Calcium Phosphate, then Charcoal. The control egg, with no toothpaste, lost the most ions, indicating that the toothpaste treatments helped to minimize ion leaching from the eggshells.

### Qualitative Data

### Explanation of Results - Why the Toothpaste worked

The egg covered in stannous fluoride showed the smallest difference in mass and conductivity, indicating that less calcium carbonate was dissolved into the vinegar. **But WHY?**
- Both calcium carbonate and calcium fluoride are held together by ionic bonds.
- The displacement of the bases improves acid resistance.
- The double displacement reaction replaces calcium carbonate in the shell with calcium fluoride, a more insoluble compound.

### Chemical Reaction: SnF₂ + CaCO₃ → SnCO₃ + CaF₂
The Kb value of carbonate is greater than that of fluoride.
- **Fluoride (F⁻):** 3.7 × 10<sup>-11</sup>	
- **Carbonate (CO₃²⁻):** 2.1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>	

Fluoride is a weaker base, so less fluoride dissociates in acidic conditions, making the calcium fluoride more resistant to dissolution than calcium carbonate.

### Calcium Phosphate:

- Calcium phosphate is insoluble in water but has an amorphous structure.
- The lack of an ordered molecular arrangement makes it less stable and more soluble.
- Under various conditions, it can dissociate and bond with more ions, forming a proper crystalline structure.
- This structure offers some acid resistance but is less effective than stannous fluoride.

## Part 2: Neutralization Rates

To test the neutralizing abilities of each toothpaste, we titrated acid into each solution and observed their pH graphs. The equivalence point was determined when the moles of base (B) equaled the moles of acid (A). From the equivalence point, we identified the midpoint, at which pOH equals pKb. 

Testing for neutralization rates helps to evaluate the effectiveness of each toothpaste in counteracting acidic conditions. Acids, such as those found in foods, drinks, or produced by bacteria in the mouth, can weaken tooth enamel through demineralization. Toothpaste neutralizes these acids, preventing damage and protecting the enamel. By comparing the neutralization rates, we can mimic real-life conditions, where many people do not brush for the recommended two minutes. Therefore, testing neutralization rates mimics real-life conditions by evaluating how effectively toothpaste works in shorter timeframes.

### Results of Neutralization Testing
- **Stannous Fluoride**: Showed the greatest initial, final, and average rates of neutralization.  
- **Calcium Phosphate**: Performed slightly less effectively than Stannous Fluoride but was still more effective than Charcoal.  
- **Charcoal**: Showed neutralization reactions but was the least effective.
  
### Why the Neutralization Worked

- **Base Strength and Conjugate Acids:**  
  - The strength of a base is inversely related to the strength of its conjugate acid.  
  - Strong acids (with higher K<sub>a</sub> values) dissociate more readily, making their conjugate bases weaker as they are less likely to accept protons.  
  - Phosphate is theoretically a stronger base than fluoride due to its smaller K<sub>a</sub>, resulting in a larger K<sub>b</sub>.  

- **Phosphate's Dissociation and Concentration:**  
  - Phosphate dissociates more readily, increasing the base concentration in solution.  
  - Higher base concentrations lead to more frequent collisions and reactions, contributing to a greater magnitude of neutralization over time.  

Despite the theoretical strength of phosphate, fluoride exhibited a greater rate of reaction, likely due to the higher concentration of fluoride ions in fluoridated toothpaste compared to the phosphate ions in Calcium Phosphate toothpaste. The increased fluoride concentration results in more frequent collisions, enhancing the reaction rate. Charcoal, although not a base, demonstrated neutralization due to its strong buffering capacity. It contains sodium cocoyl glutamate, which has a high pH of around 9 - 10, and this buffering ability caused its titration graph to resemble those of standard acid-base reactions.

## Part 3: Thermometric Titration

After studying how toothpaste can effectively neutralize acid, we wanted to investigate how a change in temperature might influence the neutralization process. Toothpaste is typically stored at around 25°C to maintain the integrity of its ingredients. To explore the effects of temperature, we heated the solutions to 60°C.

### Effects of Increased Temperature

Increasing the temperature generally leads to a faster dissociation rate. However, this does not necessarily help in neutralizing acid because the neutralization reaction is exothermic. Results have shown that each toothpaste showed a decrease in K<sub>b</sub> values when heated. A smaller Kb indicates a greater concentration of unreacted base, as the denominator in the equilibrium expression becomes larger.

All the neutralization reactions studied were exothermic, as indicated by previous molar enthalpy calculations. When the temperature is increased, the equilibrium shifts to the reactant side, reversing the reaction and increasing the reverse reaction rate. The forward reaction rate decreases, predicting a slower neutralization reaction at higher temperatures.

By understanding these principles, we could assess the impact of temperature on the efficiency of toothpaste in neutralizing acids, with the expectation that heating the solutions would slow down the neutralization due to the exothermic nature of the reactions.

## Part 4: Testing Whitening Abilities

To test the whitening abilities of each toothpaste, we first soaked eggs in coffee for 2 days to create a stain. Afterward, the eggs were placed in toothpaste solutions for 24 hours before being removed.

### Quantitative Data

For the qualitative analysis, we measured the pH and conductivity of each toothpaste solution before and after soaking the eggs. The changes in pH and conductivity provide insight into how each toothpaste interacts with the egg surface and its ability to influence the solution's properties. The following table summarizes the data collected during the experiment.


| **Type**            | **Initial pH** | **Final pH** | **pH Difference** | **Initial Conductivity (μs/cm)** | **Final Conductivity (μs/cm)** | **Conductivity Difference (μs/cm)** |

| **Charcoal**          | 7.01           | 7.81         | +0.80             | 439.3 μs/cm                     | 579.3 μs/cm                    | +140.0 μs/cm                       |
| **Control (Water)**   | 8.99           | 8.19         | -0.80             | 10.0 μs/cm                      | 253.7 μs/cm                    | +243.7 μs/cm

#### Observations and Explanation: pH and Conductivity Changes After Soaking Eggs in Toothpaste Solutions

When testing the toothpaste solutions after soaking the coffee-stained eggs, there was an increase in both pH and conductivity for all brands of toothpaste. It is shown that **Stannous Fluoride** had the greatest increase in pH and conductivity compared to the other toothpaste solutions.

**Why the Increase in Conductivity?**  

An increase in conductivity can be due to calcium carbonate leaching into the toothpaste solution. Calcium carbonate has a low solubility in water, however, the acid from the coffee can be collected in the pores of the eggshell. The acid will continue to break down the Calcium Carbonate to form Carbonic acid, which decomposes into carbon dioxide and water. The acid from the coffee wears down the eggshell, and when the egg is removed from the coffee solution, acid remains in the pores of the shell, continuing to break down the calcium carbonate. This reaction forms **carbonic acid**, which decomposes into **carbon dioxide** and **water** in the toothpaste solution.  

**Le Chatelier’s Principle and Henry’s Law:**
- According to **Henry’s Law**, the amount of gas dissolved in a solution is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas above the solution.
- **Le Chatelier’s principle** states that equilibrium will shift to minimize changes. In this case, as carbon dioxide escapes from the solution, equilibrium will shift to produce more carbon dioxide to restore balance.

Another way to understand why the conductivity increased is imagining a carbonated beverage. When opening a new can of soda, the fizziness is due to a high concentration of carbon dioxide. Over time, the fizziness decreases as carbon dioxide escapes, establishing equilibrium with the atmosphere. With carbon dioxide leaving the solution, equilibrium shifts to produce more carbon dioxide, and the concentration of **H⁺ ions** (hydrogen ions) decreases, contributing to the observed changes in pH and conductivity.

### Qualitative Data

*/ images */

  - Each egg became visibly lighter after the treatment.
  - The egg treated with stannous fluoride exhibited the whitest appearance.
  - The calcium phosphate-treated egg followed in appearance, with charcoal showing a lighter result as well.
  - Both calcium phosphate and charcoal treatments displayed some inconsistencies, with darker patches appearing in certain areas.

### Whitening Mechanism

It is important to note that the toothpastes used in this experiment are not bleaching agents and cannot break down stains through redox reactions. Instead, it is likely that the stained layer on the egg leached out into the toothpaste solution, revealing a lighter appearance underneath.
